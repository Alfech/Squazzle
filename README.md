# StickWarrior-vs-The-Tower-of-Pain
This project is a video game so I can have a better usage of all my unproductive "free" time. 

## how to build the program
To build this program, you need mgw64 and your favorite IDE installed. 
You must download the [ming64 v13.1.0](https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/download/13.1.0-16.0.5-11.0.0-msvcrt-r5/winlibs-x86_64-posix-seh-gcc-13.1.0-mingw-w64msvcrt-11.0.0-r5.7z) to run the program.<br>
To create the game, we use SFML. It is already inside the the library folder of this repo.<br>
Use the bat file to compile.
